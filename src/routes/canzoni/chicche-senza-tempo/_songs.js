    He sees the winding ocean drive<br>
    And everything was made for you and me<br>
    All of it was made for you and me<br>
    'Cause it just belongs to you and me<br>
    So let's take a ride and see what's mine<br>

    Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br>
    I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br>
    Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br>

    Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand<br>
    Vanished from my hand<br>
    Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping<br>
    My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet<br>
    I have no one to meet<br>
    And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming<br>

    My senses have been stripped<br>
    My hands can't feel to grip<br>
    My toes too numb to step<br>
    Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering<br>

    Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun<br>
    It's not aimed at anyone<br>
    It's just escaping on the run<br>
    And but for the sky there are no fences facing<br>
    And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme<br>
    To your tambourine in time<br>
    It's just a ragged clown behind<br>
    I wouldn't pay it any mind<br>
    It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing<br>

    Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br>
    In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br>
    And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind<br>
    Down the foggy ruins of time<br>
    Far past the frozen leaves<br>
    The haunted frightened trees<br>
    Out to the windy beach<br>
    Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow<br>
    Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky<br>
    With one hand waving free<br>
    Silhouetted by the sea<br>
    Circled by the circus sands<br>
    With all memory and fate<br>
    Driven deep beneath the waves<br>
    Let me forget about today until tomorrow<br>

    I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br>

    Now, Jack, he is a banker,<br>
    And Jane, she is a clerk.<br>
    And the both of them are saving up their money...<br>
    Then they come home from work.<br>
    Sittin' by the fire...<br>
    Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,<br>
    The march of the wooden soldiers<br>
    And you can hear Jack say<br>
    Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane<br>
    Some people like to go out dancing<br>
    And other people, (like us) they gotta work<br>
    And there's always some evil mothers<br>
    They'll tell you life is full of dirt.<br>
    And the women never really faint,<br>
    And the villans always blink their eyes.<br>
    And the children are the only ones who blush.<br>
    'Cause life is just to die.<br>
    But, anyone who has a heart<br>
    Wouldn't want to turn around and break it<br>
    And anyone who ever played the part<br>
    He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it<br>
    Sweet Jane

    Hey, where did we go?<br>
    Days when the rains came<br>
    Down in the hollow<br>
    Playin' a new game<br>
    Laughing and a running hey, hey<br>
    Skipping and a jumping<br>
    In the misty morning fog with<br>
    Our hearts a thumpin' and you<br>
    My brown-eyed girl<br>
    You, my brown-eyed girl<br>
    Whatever happened<br>
    To Tuesday and so slow?<br>
    Going down the old mine<br>
    With a transistor radio<br>
    Standing in the sunlight laughing<br>
    Hiding behind a rainbow's wall<br>
    Slipping and sliding<br>
    All along the waterfall, with you<br>
    My brown-eyed girl<br>
    You, my brown-eyed girl<br>
    Do you remember when we used to sing<br>
    Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da<br>
    Just like that<br>
    Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da<br>
    So hard to find my way<br>
    Now that I'm all on my own<br>
    I saw you just the other day<br>
    My, how you have grown<br>
    Cast my memory back there, Lord<br>
    Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout<br>
    Making love in the green grass<br>
    Behind the stadium with you<br>
    My brown-eyed girl<br>
    You, my brown-eyed girl<br>
    Do you remember when we used to sing<br>
    Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da<br>
    Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da<br>
    (Bit by bit, by bit, by bit, by bit, by bit)<br>

    Hello darkness, my old friend<br>
    I've come to talk with you again<br>
    Because a vision softly creeping<br>
    Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
    And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
    Still remains<br>
    Within the sound of silence<br>
    In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
    Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
    'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
    I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
    When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
    That split the night<br>
    And touched the sound of silence<br>
    And in the naked light I saw<br>
    Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
    People talking without speaking<br>
    People hearing without listening<br>
    People writing songs that voices never share<br>
    No one dared<br>
    Disturb the sound of silence<br>
    "Fools" said I, "You do not know<br>
    Silence like a cancer grows<br>
    Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
    Take my arms that I might reach you"<br>
    But my words like silent raindrops fell<br>
    And echoed in the wells of silence<br>
    And the people bowed and prayed<br>
    To the neon god they made<br>
    And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
    In the words that it was forming<br>
    And the sign said, "The words of the prophets<br>
    Are written on the subway walls<br>
    And tenement halls"<br>
    And whispered in the sounds of silence

    Well I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
    That David played and it pleased the Lord<br>
    But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
    Well it goes like this:<br>
    The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift<br>
    The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Well your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
    You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
    Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya<br>
    She tied you to her kitchen chair<br>
    And she broke your throne and she cut your hair<br>
    And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    But baby I've been here before<br>
    I've seen this room and I've walked this floor<br>
    You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya<br>
    And I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br>
    And love is not a victory march<br>
    It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Well there was a time when you let me know<br>
    What's really going on below<br>
    But now you never show that to me do ya<br>
    But remember when I moved in you<br>
    And the holy dove was moving too<br>
    And every breath we drew was Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Maybe there's a God above<br>
    But all I've ever learned from love<br>
    Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya<br>
    And it's not a cry that you hear at night<br>
    It's not somebody who's seen the light<br>
    It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>
    Hallelujah<br>

    Deep down in the jungle<br>
    I started bangin' my first bongo<br>
    Every monkey like to be<br>
    In my place instead of me<br>
    'Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby<br>
    I'm the king of bongo bong<br>
    I went to the big town<br>
    Where there is a lot of sound<br>
    From the jungle to the city<br>
    Looking for a bigger crown<br>
    So I play my boogie<br>
    For the people of big city<br>
    But they don't go crazy<br>
    When I'm bangin' in my boogie<br>
    I'm the "king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"<br>
    Hear me when I come, baby<br>
    King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong<br>
    Nobody like to be in my place instead of me<br>
    'Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie<br>
    I'm a king without a crown<br>
    Hanging loose in a big town<br>

    Hear me when I come<br>
    They say that I'm a clown<br>
    Making too much dirty sound<br>
    They say there is no place for little monkey in this town<br>
    Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me<br>

    When I get older losing my hair<br>
    Many years from now<br>
    Will you still be sending me a Valentine<br>
    Birthday greetings bottle of wine<br>
    If I'd been out till quarter to three<br>
    Would you lock the door<br>
    Will you still need me, will you still feed me<br>
    When I'm sixty-four<br>
    You'll be older too<br>
    And if you say the word<br>
    I could stay with you<br>
    I could be handy, mending a fuse<br>
    When your lights have gone<br>
    You can knit a sweater by the fireside<br>
    Sunday mornings go for a ride<br>
    Doing the garden, digging the weeds<br>
    Who could ask for more<br>
    Will you still need me, will you still feed me<br>
    When I'm sixty-four<br>
    Every summer we can rent a cottage<br>
    In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear<br>
    We shall scrimp and save<br>
    Grandchildren on your knee<br>
    Vera, Chuck and Dave<br>
    Send me a postcard, drop me a line<br>
    Stating point of view<br>
    Indicate precisely what you mean to say<br>
    Yours sincerely, wasting away<br>
    Give me your answer, fill in a form<br>
    Mine for evermore<br>
    Will you still need me, will you still feed me<br>
    When I'm sixty-four
